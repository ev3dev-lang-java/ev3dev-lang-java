/**
 * Abstraction for an NXT/EV3 button. Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * EV3Key.ENTER.waitForPressAndRelease();
 * Sound.playTone(1000, 1);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Notions:</b> The API is designed around two notions: states (up / down)
 * and events (press / release). It is said that a button is pressed (press
 * event), if its state changes from up to down. Similarly, it is said that a
 * button is released (release event), if its states changed from down to up.
 *
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>: All methods that return buttons states can be used
 * safely from multiple threads, even while a call to one of the waitFor*
 * methods active. However, it is not safe to invoke waitFor* methods in
 * parallel from different threads. This includes the waitFor* methods of
 * different buttons. For example EV3Key.ENTER.waitForPress() must not be
 * invoked in parallel to EV3Key.ESCAPE.waitForPress() or the static
 * EV3Key.waitForAnyEvent(). In case this is needed, it is strongly recommended
 * that you write your own Thread, which waits for button events and dispatches
 * the events to anyone who's interested.
