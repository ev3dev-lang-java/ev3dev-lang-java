/**
 * Classes used to interact with low level objects in a Device supported by EV3Dev.
 *
 * This package handles the concept about a Input/Output Device.
 * A Device could be a Motor or a Sensor, but not every device is supported for all Supported platforms on EV3Dev.
 * Besides, it is possible that in Runtime a Device is not detected on EV3Dev.
